# BackendIntern
This is an API that integrates:
1. User signup
2. Users posting
3. Users upvoting and downvoting on posts
4. Users editing, deleting and finding posts already created
5. Users commenting on posts
6. Users finding comments on a particular post

It took some time to finish up all the features as i encountered bugs (user not found, Database disconnection) and error (correct routes access) that needed resolving.
I know this may come after the 24hr deadline but i wanted the finish up to impress.
